# Cpp00

Welcome to the **Cpp00** module project!

This repository contains solutions and exercises for the Cpp00 module, an introductory project in C++ programming, typically designed for students at 42 School. The goal of this module is to help you get started with C++ syntax, object-oriented programming, and fundamental concepts.

## Project Objectives

- Learn and practice basic C++ syntax.
- Understand and implement classes and objects.
- Explore constructors, destructors, and member functions.
- Get familiar with basic input/output operations.
- Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Structure

The repository is organized by exercise, each focusing on a specific topic in C++. You will find the source files and, where necessary, accompanying headers for each part of the project.

## Getting Started

To compile and run any of the exercises:
```bash
make
./<executable_name>
```
Replace `<executable_name>` with the specific name of the program for each exercise.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make utility

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository or submit pull requests if you want to improve the code or documentation.

## License

This project is for educational purposes.
